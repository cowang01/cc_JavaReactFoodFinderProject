ABOUT.

The foodfinder application is a group project by Graham Cowan, Neil Mclaren, Peter Sullivan and Sarabjeet Kaur.

Planned, designed and tested over six days, this application was constructed to enable a user to choose either a relevant recipe or local dining out experience.  Taking information from two API sources and constructing our own API for database storage, the user would state their favoured cuisine and a favoured main ingredient.

The foodFinderProject uses
  - Backend written and run in JAVA IntelliJ
  - PSQL local database 'foodfinderservice'
  - React js frontent run on localhost.
